We're proud of it.</p></div></aside><section><article><p>The story of The Mattress Secret started with a simple idea. Figure out a way to help people across America (and maybe the world someday) get a better night's sleep. But let me start out by introducing myself and at the beginning. My name is Tom. After sleeping my whole life on either a cheap foam mattress or a hand-me-down inner spring model, I was ready for a change. Searching for an alternative, I investigated some options; I was trying to figure out if I could find an affordable way to replace my mattress and actually get a comfortable night's rest.</p><p>Looking at the Tempir-Pedic mattresses, I was more than impressed by the quality of the material and the feel of lying down on the viscoelastic bed. Yet, to my dismay, when I tried to find out how much it would cost, I was not only disappointed, but also discouraged. Now let me be completely honest. I was shocked. How could such revolutionary technology be priced in a way that no one could afford to buy it? At over $3000 for one of the less expensive models, I was convinced that there must be a way to buy the same type of mattress for less.</p><p>After researching various companies online, I was slowly becoming frustrated at the lack of options. Either the product the company sold seemed of poor or substantially lower quality, or the company didn't sell their products directly to consumers, only to large retail stores. Determined to find a way to get the product I needed for the price I was able to pay, I kept searching. But alas, the only thing I managed to find was confusion and discouragement. Yet ironically, the answer was right under my nose the whole time.</p><p>You see, my father works in the furniture business as a Sales Rep. This means that he represents various companies who need a way to sell their wholesale products to their retail clients. Luckily for me, when I finally mentioned my problem to my father. He was able to suggest a possible solution. Buy my mattress from one of the companies he used to represent. At first, I was skeptical that the product from one of these companies would be up to the high level of quality I wanted, but I managed to convince my dad to buy one of the mattresses for himself (through a connection he still had at the factory). Arriving quickly, the mattress looked great. Vacuum-sealed directly from the manufacturer, I immediately opened it and was soon able to try it out.</p><p>Again, I want to tell you that I'm being completely frank with you when I say that I couldn't believe how good it felt. I just <strong>couldn't</strong> believe that this mattress wasn't a Tempir-Pedic and didn't cost anywhere near $3000. And that's when I realized what I had to do. You might say its silly of me, but I felt like I had found an amazing way that I could help people all across America. It felt great to actually have thought of a good idea for once, an idea that would help to alleviate the sleep deprived people of the nation. The rest is history.</p><p>The Mattress Secret not only aims to help individuals replace their current mattresses, but hopes to one day convince the families all across the nation to invest in their children and replace their out-dated inner spring mattresses with viscoelastic pressure relieving ones: Mattresses that could help parents, and youngsters alike, maximize the amount of rest they could get during stressful times, when a typical night's sleep can sometimes be only 6 hours, or less. For less than the price of the gas you buy in one month, anyone can now purchase an important investment in their future and in their lives. For less than 1/5 of the price of one of the less expensive Tempir-Pedic mattresses, The Mattresses Secret offers a product that is virtually equivalent. We use the same temperature sensitive viscoelastic pressure relieving memory-cell technology, which until now, was well out of the budget of the average American.</p></article></section><section><header><h2>Our Premium Supplier: Primo International</h2><h3>Some Information to Assure You of Our Quality and Seriousness</h3></header><article><header><h4>About Primo</h4></header><article><p>"What makes this company successful is that we are a family that shares a vision.
